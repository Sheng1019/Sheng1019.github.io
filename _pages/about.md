I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, at George Mason University, under the supervision of [Prof. Weiwen Jiang](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/wjiang8). I also work closely with [Prof. Yiyu Shi](https://engineering.nd.edu/faculty/yiyu-shi/) at the University of Notre Dame, [Prof. Jingtong Hu](https://sites.pitt.edu/~jthu/) at the University of Pittsburgh, and [Prof. Lei Yang](https://www.gmu.edu/profiles/lyang) at George Mason University.

I received my Bachelor’s degree from Jilin University, China, and my Master's degree from Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya in Spain.

Research Interest
------
Design Automation (System) + Medical (Domain) + AI (Method) = Efficient Medical AI System

\\
Summary: My research agenda is anchored in advancing AI technology in the medical domain. I am actively engaged in Electronic Design Automation (EDA) for AI systems, medical image computing, and AI fairness. My research goal is to bridge the practice gap between AI and domain applications, especially in achieving fair, energy-efficient, and time-efficient Medical AI Systems.
